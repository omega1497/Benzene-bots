Truck Platooning is linking of two or more trucks, that drive in a queue. This helps with reducing the air resistance experienced by the trucks at the back of the first truck and reduces the likelihood of being indulged in accidents.

This is a simple simulation of a **Truck Platooning** System.

As illustrated by the use case diagram, A truck might join or leave the platoon, it then might get elected as the leader as well. Speed synchronization was another aspect that was kept in great consideration. The following sections emphasis more on how communication takes place or how speed synchronization was ensured.
