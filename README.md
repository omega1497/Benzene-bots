# Truck Platooning

Truck Platooning is linking of two or more trucks, that drive in a queue. This helps with reducing the air resistance experienced by the trucks at the back of the first truck and reduces the likelihood of being indulged in accidents.

This is a simple simulation of a **Truck Platooning** System.
